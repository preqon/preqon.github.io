Hi, I'm preqon. 

I'm a graduate in neuroscience and computer science, seeking opportunities
in R&D for neurotechnology for medical applications.

Here's a bio that explains why.

Leaving high school, I wanted to understand the natural structure of materials
around me and what consciousness was. I pursued chemistry and neuroscience. 
Electrochemical interactions explain alot of material structure, and neuroscience
certainly attempts to explain conscious phenomena. (I actually find research
directions here very promising; and I don't view the Hard Problem of 
Consciousness as something that will be *too* hard).   

In the third year of my B Sc., it became more pressing to choose a career path.
Neurotechnology attracted me, (at this stage, it was honestly for its 
science-fiction-like allure). I did a little research into what disciplines are
needed in neurotechnology;
I didn't have the best understanding, but computer science seemed like a
reasonable choice. Only it was too late to start a new major. So, I decide to
delay my graduation and turn my B Sc. into a combined degree, with B Advanced
Computing.

I then fell in love with computer science for its own sake. Particularly,
the delight in finding an optimal information representation and designing its
transformations. I started tutoring and assisting lecturers in the School of 
Computer Science. Three years of teaching students taught me how to study and 
how to explain a technical idea to people of all educational backgrounds.

Towards the end of my combined degree, I started taking courses in AI, ML and
computational neuroscience. This really felt like the culmination of everything
I had been studying. It was a beautiful feeling. I was in awe of information
processing as it appears in computer systems and in nature.

But it had always been in the back of my mind to turn my passion for neuroscience
and computer science into a craft; into the development of neurotechnology that
can change lives. Through experiences like attempting medical device development
with a group of students, interning at Emotiv, building a VR solution for 
concussion diagnostics and just getting out there and talking to industry 
leaders in neurotechnology, I've learned about how wide the gap can be between 
shiny new devices and the needs that patients suffering neurological illnesses 
actually have.

My goal now is to understand patient needs, and apply my domain of 
knowledge/skillset to make a functional improvement to their lives; wherever
they need it. That way, I can turn my inherent curiosities, into a craft that
serves people, and grow my passion for that craft.

I hope to write about my craft on this web site, and also show any personal
projects. I will still be reading widely (and writing) about questions 
in consciousness, neural computation, and intelligence (natural or artificial).

Much further down the line, if ever, my skill set and domain knowledge
might let me make a contribution to general human augmentation. Though please
note this isn't a necessary end goal of mine; I have no end goal, beyond
bringing a given project to completion, that utilises my skill set, and helps 
people.
