Hi, I'm preqon. I needed a place to show off my career goals, body of work and
general trajectory inside the world of intelligence so here it is.

Quick bio:

- In high school, my greatest curiosity was in answering what consciousness is.
I was also a big nerd and lover of science fiction. I decided to pursue 
undergraduate neuroscience to this end.
- I became interested in neurotechnology for its science fiction-like appeal
and decided to dive into the world of technology via computer science. My
two majors were now neuroscience and computer science.
- I fell in love with computer science for its own sake; discovering the genius
behind optimising information representation and transformation. I spent
the second half of undergraduate tutoring various subjects for USYD's School of
Computer Science.
- In my final semesters I took a few advanced courses in artificial 
intelligence, marvelling at the various methods to engineer intelligence.
I had also discovered the world of computational neuroscience and suddenly it 
clicked how neural systems are nature's solutions to information processing.
This might seem obvious, but it now felt *within reach* to discover powerful 
ways to replicate or at least interact with computation performed by neural 
systems for medical or general use. 
- By the time I graduated in 2023, it became clear that all my interests 
essentially revolve around intelligence - be it natural or artificial. My
immediate goal is to work in the engineering and research of brain-computer 
interfaces. I believe this will allow me to keep learning inside my interests 
while also contributing to improving people's lives via novel technology.
