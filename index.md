Hi, I'm preqon. I needed a place to show off my career goals, body of work and
general trajectory inside the world of intelligence so here it is.

Here's a quick biography to explain my motivations.

In high school, my biggest questions were in consciousness, leading me to
pursue neuroscience. I was then drawn to the sci-fi allure of neurotechnology
and decided to add computer science as a second major. I fell in love
with computer science for its own sake - particularly the genius behind 
optimising information representation and transformation. In later semesters I
ended up tutoring for USYD's School of Computer Science. I also elected to take
courses in artificial intelligence and discovered computational neuroscience.
While marvelling at human and nature's solutions to information processing, it 
suddenly felt within reach for us to replicate or at least interact with 
computation occurring in neural systems.

Now, after graduating in 2023 and realising that my passion revolves around 
intelligence, whether natural or artificial, my focus is in brain-computer 
interfaces. My hope is to blend my interests into novel technologies for 
the betterment of lives.

intelligence and neurotechnology
