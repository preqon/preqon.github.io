COMP5328: *Advanced Machine Learning* taught by Dr 
[Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io/index.html)
was a rather grueling expedition into the theoretical side of machine learning.
The course formalised, with much more mathematical rigour, alot of the concepts
I had previously encountered. I published my notes from the 2022 version of the
course on GitHub for future students to look at.
