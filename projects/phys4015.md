PHYS4015: *Neural Dynamics and Computation* taught by A/Professor 
[Pulin Gong](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/pulin-gong.html)
represented my first true foray into computational neuroscience. I loved it. 
I published my notes from the 2022 version of the course on GitHub for future
students to look at.
